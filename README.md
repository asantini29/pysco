# pysco: PYthon ShortCuts & Others

`pysco` is a Python module that contains some plotting routines I usually use and other useful snippets.

## Installing:
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/asantini29/pysco.git
   cd pysco`
2. Run install:
   `python setup.py install`

## Tools:
Some of the main routines currently implemented in `pysco` :
1. **plot**: `pysco.plot` contains custom settings for `matplotlib`([here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/)) and `corner`([here](https://corner.readthedocs.io/)). Currently, some features of `pysco.plot.corner` are available only when using my edited fork of `corner`(available [here](https://github.com/asantini29/corner.py)).
